# Privacy Policy for Simple Timer

## Last Updated: Aug 30, 2025

## This privacy policy outlines the data handling practices for the "Simple Timer" Chrome Extension.

### Data Collection

The "Simple Timer" extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data. We do not track your browsing history, your activity, or any personal information.

### Data Storage

To provide its core functionality, the extension saves user-configured timer presets (e.g., the time values you set for the buttons). This data is stored locally on your computer using the chrome.storage.sync API provided by the Google Chrome browser. This data is not accessible to the developer and is never transmitted to any third-party servers.

### Permissions

The extension requires certain permissions to function correctly, such as "alarms" to run timers in the background and "scripting" to display the floating timer on web pages. These permissions are used solely to provide the advertised features of the extension.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version of the extension.
